Performed using the ___ HIV-1 Test v2.0.  Detection Range: 20-10,000,000 copies/mL.  This test is approved for monitoring HIV-1 viral load in known HIV-positive patients. It is not approved for diagnosis of acute HIV infection.  In symptomatic acute HIV infection (acute retroviral syndrome), the viral load is usually very high (>>1000 copies/mL). If acute HIV infection is clinically suspected and there is a detectable but low viral load, please contact the laboratory for interpretation.  It is recommended that any NEW positive HIV-1 viral load result, in the absence of positive serology, be confirmed by submitting a new sample FOR HIV-1 PCR, in addition to serological testing.  "
